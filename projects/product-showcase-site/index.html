                <p>
                    Ultimate Whey Protein contains a quality blend of whey 
                    concentrate and isolate proteins with a naturally occurring 
                    amino acid complex. Each serving provides a high level of 
                    protein (24 g) and 5.7 g BCAAs (Branched Chain Amino Acids). 
                    Actazin® has also been included, a protease enzyme sourced 
                    from New Zealand kiwi fruit which breaks down protein into 
                    smaller peptides for better absorption in the body. 
                    Even better, this great tasting protein blend has a 
                    luxurious natural chocolate flavour and is easy to mix. 
                    It’s also low in sugar, and contains no unnecessary 
                    ingredients or artificial sweeteners (we use a natural 
                    sweetener in Stevia).
