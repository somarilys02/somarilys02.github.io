            <b>Crown shyness</b>(also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,
            [2] or inter-crown spacing[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some 
            tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
            touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] 
            The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
            but also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] There 
            exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive 
            behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
            leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.[6] 
            The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since 
            the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results 
            might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
            species, an example of convergent evolution.

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced 
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the 
            crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they 
            gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains instances of 
            crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of 
            this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions 
            conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of 
            flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
            flexible and limited in lateral movement.[6][12] According to this 
            theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences 
            the degree of crown shyness.
