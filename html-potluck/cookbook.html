        <h3><i>Directions</i></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the ingredients for the dough in a medium saucepan. Let 
                the mixture melt and come to a rolling boil, stirring 
                frequently. Then, reduce heat to low. Add in flour and stir 
                constantly with a wooden spoon until incorporated and the 
             mixture forms a thick, smooth ball and appears to dry out.</li>
            <li> 
                Immediately transfer dough to a large bowl and beat on medium 
                speed with a hand mixer for a couple minutes to cool the mixture 
            slightly.</li>
            <li>Add in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, 
            until fully combined. It should appear smooth and creamy</li>
            <li>Spoon dough into a piping bag fitted with a large open star 
            tip (we used an Ateco 829.)</li>
            <li>Add 2 inches of oil to a large skillet and heat until a 
                temperature of 360 degrees F is reached. Holding the pastry tip 
                close to the oil to prevent splashing, carefully pipe 3-inch 
                strips of dough over the skillet, cutting the end with kitchen 
                scissors, and drop into the hot oil. Repeat until churro bites 
                fill skillet without over-crowding. Fry churros until golden 
                brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side, turning with tongs, as 
                necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer churros to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain 
            for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>In a medium shallow bowl, whisk together cinnamon and 
            sugar.</li>
            <li>Toss to coat in the cinnamon-sugar while they’re still warm.
                and Enjoy!
