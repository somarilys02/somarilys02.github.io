        <h1>Fluffernutter Muddy Buddies</h1>
        <p>
            I was absolutely obsessed with Muddy Buddies growing up, but this 
            version takes it to the next level. They’ve got all the nostalgic 
            flavors I loved as a kid, with a fluffernutter twist thanks to 
            peanut butter and marshmallow fluff. Sweet, crunchy, and completely 
            addictive—you’ll want to make a big batch because they 
            disappear fast.

            <li>1/3 cup marshmallow fluff</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            OPTIONAL MIX-INS:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>mini marshmallows</li>

            <li>reese’s Pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chex cereal to a large mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium pot over low heat, add the chocolate chips, 
                peanut butter, butter, marshmallow fluff, vanilla extract, 
                and salt. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula until smooth 
                and fully melted, about 5–7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture over the Rice Chex and very gently fold 
                with the rubber spatula until all the cereal is 
                evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Allow the coated cereal to cool for about 4 to 5 minutes 
                so it’s no longer piping hot, but not fully hardened.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large zip-top bag or container, 
                add the powdered sugar (adding as much or as little 
                as you like), seal, and shake until the cereal 
                is well coated.</li>
            <li>Optional: Spread onto a baking sheet to finish cooling 
                and setting. This isn’t necessary, but it can help the 
                mix stay extra crispy.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, mix in any of the optional add-ins like 
                mini marshmallows, peanut butter cups, or Reese’s Pieces 
                or just leave as is like the original!</li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container or ziploc back at 
                room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
